 DATA STRUCTURE:
    -Data Struture is about how data can be store and use in different Strutures.

ALGORITHEM:
    -Algorithm is a step-by-step procedure for solving a problem.

ASYMPTOTIC NOTATIOIN:
    -Asymptotic notation is used to describe the time and space complexity of an algorithm.

    -There are mainly three type of notation:
        1. Big O notation: It is used to describe the upper bound or wrost case of an algorithm's time or
           space complexity.

        2. Big Ω notation: It is used to describe the lower bound of an algorithm's time or
           space complexity.

        3. Big Θ notation: It is used to describe the exact time or space complexity of an algorithm.


    -There are mainly two types of complexity for any program:
        1. Time complexity: It is the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of
           the size of the input.
        
        2. Space complexity: It is the amount of memory an algorithm takes to complete as a function of
           the size of the input.
