// â€¢ Dynamic Casting: Create a base class Media with a virtual function play(). Derive classes
// Music and Video from Media and override the play() function. Write a function that takes a
// Media* pointer and uses dynamic_cast to check if it's a Music or Video object and then call
// the appropriate play() function.
